This is a project which I made during my training in Frontend Web Development using React.

It is a single page application which imitates the actions required in a website designed for restaurants.

This website was designed using the frameworks Bootstrap 4 and React.

The necessary databases and media files have been provided using a static json-server.

The following npm packages were used and hence, need to be installed beforehand to successfully run the application:
bootstrap
bootstrap-social
cross-fetch
font-awesome
prop-types
reactstrap
react-popper
react-redux
react-router-dom
react-transition-group
react-animation-components
react-redux-form
redux
redux-thunk
redux-logger

If the application does not work through json-server, the required files have been provided at the locations:
./public/assets/images
./src/shared
So, the application can be made to work by accessing these files and making corresponding changes to the program.
WARNING: Due to the changes made, some functions and features might not work!
